# ISL
Implementation of ISL (Information seeking learner) with Python3+TensorFLow.

This is an implementation of the ISL algorithm introduced in:
"ISL: Optimal Policy Learning With Optimal Exploration-Exploitation Trade-Off" (Cassano et al., 2019)

# Getting started.
1) Install bsuite (https://github.com/deepmind/bsuite) with its corresponding dependencies.
2) Paste the ISL folder inside of the bsuite/baselines directory.
3) You can now run an ISL agent like any other baseline provided by bsuite.
